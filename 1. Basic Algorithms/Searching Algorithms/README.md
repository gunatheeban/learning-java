#### **Searching Algorithms**
- **Linear Search:** Sequentially checks each element.
- **Binary Search:** Efficiently searches a sorted array.
- **Ternary Search:** Divides the array into three parts for searching.
- **Exponential Search:** Combines binary search with exponential steps.

**Why Practice?** Searching algorithms are crucial for data retrieval and optimization.
