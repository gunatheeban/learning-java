#### **Sorting Algorithms**
- **Bubble Sort:** Simple comparison-based sort.
- **Selection Sort:** Selects the smallest element and moves it to the front.
- **Insertion Sort:** Builds the sorted array one element at a time.
- **Merge Sort:** Divide-and-conquer approach, stable and efficient.
- **Quick Sort:** Divide-and-conquer, uses pivot element for partitioning.
- **Heap Sort:** Uses a binary heap to sort elements.
- **Radix Sort:** Non-comparative integer sorting algorithm.
- **Bucket Sort:** Distributes elements into buckets and sorts each one.
  
**Why Practice?** Sorting is fundamental in many algorithms, and understanding their mechanisms helps with optimization problems.
