#### **Linear Data Structures**
- **Arrays:** Fixed-size data structure for storing elements.
- **Linked Lists:** Dynamic data structure with nodes connected by pointers.
  - **Singly Linked List**
  - **Doubly Linked List**
  - **Circular Linked List**
- **Stacks:** Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure.
- **Queues:** First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure.
  - **Circular Queue**
  - **Priority Queue**
  - **Deque (Double-ended queue)**
  
**Why Practice?** Linear data structures form the basis of many applications, such as compilers and memory management.
