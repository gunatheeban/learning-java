#### **Non-Linear Data Structures**
- **Trees:** Hierarchical data structure.
  - **Binary Tree**
  - **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
  - **AVL Tree:** Self-balancing binary search tree.
  - **Red-Black Tree:** Another self-balancing binary search tree.
  - **Segment Tree:** Supports range queries.
  - **Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree):** Supports prefix queries.
  - **B-Tree:** Generalization of a binary search tree.
- **Graphs:** Collection of nodes connected by edges.
  - **Adjacency Matrix and List Representations**
  - **Directed and Undirected Graphs**
  - **Weighted and Unweighted Graphs**
  
**Why Practice?** Understanding tree and graph structures is essential for complex problem-solving in areas like network theory, databases, and computational biology.
