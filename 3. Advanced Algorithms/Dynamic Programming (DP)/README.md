#### **Dynamic Programming (DP)**
- **Fibonacci Sequence:** Classic DP problem with overlapping subproblems.
- **Knapsack Problem:** 0/1 knapsack and fractional knapsack variations.
- **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):** Finds the longest subsequence present in two sequences.
- **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS):** Finds the longest increasing subsequence.
- **Matrix Chain Multiplication:** Optimal way to multiply matrices.
- **Edit Distance:** Minimum number of operations to convert one string to another.
- **Subset Sum Problem:** Checks if there is a subset with a given sum.
- **Coin Change Problem:** Finds the minimum number of coins needed to make change.
- **Rod Cutting Problem:** Cuts a rod to maximize profit.
- **Word Break Problem:** Determines if a string can be segmented into words from a dictionary.

**Why Practice?** Dynamic Programming helps solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems, widely used in optimization.
