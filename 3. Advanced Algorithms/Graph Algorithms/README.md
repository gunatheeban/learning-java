#### **Graph Algorithms**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Explores as far as possible along branches before backtracking.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finds the shortest path from a single source.
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:** Computes shortest paths from a single source with negative weights.
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:** Finds shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.
- **A* Search Algorithm:** Pathfinding algorithm that uses heuristics.
- **Kruskal's Algorithm:** Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm using edges sorted by weight.
- **Prim's Algorithm:** Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm using priority queue.
- **Topological Sorting:** Linear ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph.
- **Tarjan's Algorithm:** Finds strongly connected components.
- **Kosaraju's Algorithm:** Another algorithm to find strongly connected components.

**Why Practice?** Graph algorithms are critical for network routing, web search engines, and social network analysis.
