### 5. **Mathematics and Number Theory**

- **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):** Euclidean algorithm.
- **Least Common Multiple (LCM):** Calculation using GCD.
- **Prime Numbers:** Sieve of Eratosthenes for finding all primes.
- **Modular Arithmetic:** Operations under modulo.
- **Exponentiation by Squaring:** Efficient method for exponentiation.
- **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT):** Efficient polynomial multiplication.
- **Chinese Remainder Theorem:** Solves simultaneous congruences.
- **Fermat's Little Theorem:** Properties of numbers in modular arithmetic.
- **Wilson's Theorem:** Prime number identification.
- **Euler's Totient Function:** Counts integers up to a given integer that are coprime with it.
- **Matrix Exponentiation:** Powers of matrices for solving linear recurrences.

**Why Practice?** Mathematical algorithms form the basis for cryptography, computer graphics, and simulations.
