### 6. **Greedy Algorithms**

- **Activity Selection Problem:** Selects the maximum number of activities that don't overlap.
- **Huffman Coding:** Optimal prefix codes for data compression.
- **Kruskal's and Prim's Algorithm:** Greedy methods for Minimum Spanning Tree.
- **Job Sequencing Problem:** Maximizes profit for given jobs.
- **Fractional Knapsack Problem:** Optimal solution using a greedy approach.
- **Interval Scheduling:** Maximizing the number of non-overlapping intervals.

**Why Practice?** Greedy algorithms provide optimal solutions for many problems efficiently and are often easier to implement.
