### 7. **Divide and Conquer Algorithms**

- **Merge Sort:** Sorting using divide and conquer.
- **Quick Sort:** Partitioning approach for sorting.
- **Binary Search:** Efficient searching in sorted arrays.
- **Strassen's Algorithm:** Matrix multiplication using divide and conquer.
- **Closest Pair of Points:** Finds the closest pair in 2D space.
- **Karatsuba Algorithm:** Efficient integer multiplication.
- **Count Inversions:** Counts inversions in an array.
- **Finding the Median:** Median of two sorted arrays.

**Why Practice?** Divide and conquer algorithms break a problem into smaller subproblems, solve them independently, and combine their solutions.
