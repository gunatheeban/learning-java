### 9. **Bit Manipulation**

- **Bitwise Operations:** AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left shift, and right shift.
- **Counting Bits:** Counting the number of 1s in binary representation.
- **Power of Two:** Check if a number is a power of two.
- **Subset Generation:** Generate subsets using bitmasks.
- **Bitwise Sieve:** Finding primes using bit manipulation.
- **Gray Code:** Binary reflected Gray code sequence.
- **Single Number:** Finding the unique number in an array where every other number appears twice.
- **Reverse Bits:** Reverse the bits of a given number.

**Why Practice?** Bit manipulation allows low-level data processing and is crucial in competitive programming and optimization tasks.
